Place your logo file here as `logo.png`.

Recommended:
- Size: 512x512 PNG (transparent background if possible)
- Also keep a 180x180 version for Apple Touch if you want

This file path is referenced by:
- Favicon: <link rel="icon" href="assets/logo.png">
- OpenGraph: <meta property="og:image" content="assets/logo.png">
- Header brand image: <img class="brand-logo" src="assets/logo.png">

If the file is missing, the site falls back to the gradient badge with your initials.
